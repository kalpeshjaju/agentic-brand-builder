# Task
Synthesize the provided UX analysis reports into a single, actionable UX strategy document.

## Synthesis Framework

### 1. Identify Top 5 Overarching UX Themes
- Look for recurring issues and opportunities across the UX Audit, Review Analysis, and JTBD reports.
- Examples: "Complex checkout process," "Lack of trust signals," "Mobile usability issues."

### 2. Consolidate Key Findings
- For each theme, summarize the supporting evidence from each report.
- **UX Audit Evidence**: Heuristic violations, specific UI element issues.
- **Review Analysis Evidence**: Direct customer quotes, common pain points.
- **JTBD Evidence**: Underserved customer jobs, critical pains and gains.

### 3. Strategic Recommendations
- For each theme, provide a high-level strategic recommendation.
- Example: "Redesign the checkout flow to be a single-page experience."

### 4. Prioritized UX Roadmap (Next 3-6 Months)
- Create a high-level roadmap with 3-5 key initiatives.
- Prioritize based on:
  - **Impact**: How much will this improve the user experience and business goals?
  - **Effort**: How difficult will this be to implement?
- Use a simple "High," "Medium," "Low" scale for impact and effort.

### 5. Quick Wins
- Identify 3-5 "low-hanging fruit" improvements that are high-impact and low-effort.
